xubuntu-setup
=============

Scripts for setting up Xubuntu according to my preferences after it's clean install.

They were tested with Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit Minimal CD, which I install to external flash drive and boot on Apple MacBook Pro (MacBookPro5,5), Apple Mac mini (Macmini5,2), 3Q Clutch EN8901N and VirtualBox.

Usage:

1. Install Xubuntu 12.10.
2. Login to the system and open Terminal.
3. `bash -eu <(wget -qO- tinyurl.com/xubuntu-setup)`
4. `~/.local/src/xubuntu-setup/xubuntu-setup`
