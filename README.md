xubuntu-setup
=============

Scripts for setting up Xubuntu according to my preferences after it's clean install.

They were tested with Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit Minimal CD, which I install to external flash drive and boot on Apple MacBook Pro (MacBookPro5,5), Apple Mac mini (Macmini5,2), 3Q Clutch EN8901N and VirtualBox.
